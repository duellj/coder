This is a standalone script developed by sun that only concentrates on
formatting code and the style review.

This is an alternative approach to the coder module.  Having two different

becomes - in effect - a unit test upon the other. This is a great way for them
to both improve, and maintain accuracy in what is a very detail oriented area!
